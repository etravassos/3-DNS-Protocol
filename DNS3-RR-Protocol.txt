       Third Party DNS operator to Registrars/Registries Protocol
         draft-ietf-regext-dnsoperator-to-rrr-protocol-01ab.txt

Abstract

   There are several problems that arise in the standard
   Registrant/Registrar/Registry model when the operator of a zone is
   neither the Registrant nor the Registrar for the delegation.
   Historically the issues have been minor, and limited to difficulty
   guiding the Registrant through the initial changes to the NS records
   for the delegation.  As this is usually a one time activity when the
   operator first takes charge of the zone it has not been treated as a
   serious issue.

   On the other hand, when the domain is signed with DNSSEC it is
   necessary for the DS records in the parent delegation to be changed
   regularly in order to track KSK rollover.  In the current model, this
   is subject to delays, as the DNS operator must get the attention of
   the registrant, and is error prone, as the registrant must
   successfully copy and paste DS data or DNSKEY data, which is
   difficult to visually compare.

   There is a need for a simple protocol that allows a third party DNS
   operator to update DS and NS records for a delegation, in a trusted
   manner, without involving the registrant in each operation.

   The protocol described in this draft is REST based, and when used
   through an authenticated channel can be used to establish the DNSSEC
   Initial Trust (to turn on DNSSEC or bootstrap DNSSEC).  Once DNSSEC
   trust is established this channel can be used to trigger maintenance
   of delegation records such as DS, NS, and glue records.  The protocol
   is kept as simple as possible.

1.  Introduction

   DNS registration systems are designed around making registrations
   easy and fast.  When it comes to setting up the master (or primary)
   DNS service, the level of ease varies greatly depending on whether
   the DNS operator is the registrar, registrant, or a third party.

   When the registrar is the DNS operator, it is able to directly and
   automatically make changes at the registray as necessary.  If the
   registrant is the DNS operator, they can make whatever changes they
   need using whatever interface the registrar provides.  A third party
   DNS operator, on the other hand, must go through the registrant (who
   may or may not be technically capable) in order to have changes
   submitted through the registrar to the registry.

   There are many examples of common failure modes with a third-party
   DNS operator:

   o  submission of incorrect data to the registrar due to copy and
      paste errors, or unintentionally omitting important data

   o  registrants failing to submit data to the registrar in a timely
      manner

   o  failure to remove DS records when moving from a DNS operator that
      supports DNSSEC to one that does not

   These sorts of human errors can result in partial or complete failure
   of a zone for anyone using a DNSSEC validating resolver.  The
   protocol described by this draft is intended to simplify the process
   of updating delegation information, for both the registrant and third
   party DNS operators, by enabling automation and eliminating obvious
   and common sources of human error.

2.  Notional Conventions

2.1.  Definitions

   For the purposes of this draft, a third-party DNS Operator is any DNS
   Operator responsible for a zone where the operator is neither the
   Registrant nor the Registrar of record for the delegation.

   Uses of the word 'Registrar' in this document may also be applied to
   resellers: an entity that sells delegations through a registrar with
   whom the entity has a reseller agreement.

2.2.  RFC2119 Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  What is the goal?

   The primary goal is to use the DNS protocol to provide information
   from child zone to the parent zone, to maintain the delegation
   information.  The precondition for this to be practical is that the
   domain is DNSSEC signed.

   In the general case there should be a way to find the right
   Registrar/Registry entity to talk to but that does not exist.
   Whois[] is the natural protocol to carry such information but that
   protocol is unreliable and hard to parse.  Its proposed successor
   RDAP [RFC7480] has yet be deployed on most TLD's.

   The preferred communication mechanism is to use is to use a REST
   [RFC6690] call to start processing of the requested delegation
   information.

3.1.  Why DNSSEC?

   DNSSEC [RFC4035] provides data authentication for DNS answers, having
   DNSSEC enabled makes it possible to trust the answers.  The biggest
   stumbling block is deploying DNSSEC is the initial configuration of
   the DNSSEC domain trust anchor in the parent, DS record.

3.2.  How does a child signal its parent it wants DNSSEC Trust Anchor?

   The child needs first to sign the domain, then the child can "upload"
   the DS record to its parent.  The "normal" way to upload is to go
   through registration interface, but that fails frequently.  The DNS
   Operator may not have access to the interface thus the registrant
   needs to relay the information.  For large operations this does not
   scale, as evident in lack of Trust Anchors for signed deployments
   that are operated by third parties.

   The child can signal its desire to have DNSSEC validation enabled by
   publishing one of the special DNS records CDS and/or CDNSKEY[RFC7344]
   and its proposed extension [I-D.ietf-dnsop-maintain-ds].

   Once the "parent" "sees" these records it SHOULD start acceptance
   processing.  This document will cover below how to make the CDS
   records visible to the right parental agent.

   We and [I-D.ogud-dnsop-maintain-ds] argue that the publication of
   CDS/CDNSKEY record is sufficient for the parent to start the
   acceptance processing.  The main point is to provide authentication
   thus if the child is in "good" state then the DS upload should be
   simple to accept and publish.  If there is a problem the parent has
   ability to not add the DS.

3.3.  What checks are needed by parent?

   The parent upon receiving a signal that it check the child for desire
   for DS record publication.  The basic tests include,

   1. The zone is signed
   2. The zone has a CDS signed by a KSK referenced in the current DS,
      referring to a at least one key in the current DNSKEY RRset
   3. All the name-servers for the zone agree on the CDS RRset contents

   Parents can have additional tests, defined delays, queries over TCP,
   and even ask the DNS Operator to prove they can add data to the zone,
   or provide a code that is tied to the affected zone.  The protocol is
   partially-synchronous, i.e. the server can elect to hold connection
   open until the operation has concluded or it can return that it

   received the request.  It is up to the child to monitor the parent
   for completion of the operation and issue possible follow-up calls.

4.  OP-3-DNS-RR RESTful API

   The specification of this API is minimalist, but a realistic one.
   Question: How to respond if the party contacted is not ALLOWED to
   make the requested change?

4.1.  Authentication

   The API does not impose any unique server authentication
   requirements.  The server authentication provided by TLS fully
   addresses the needs.  In general, for the API SHOULD be provided over
   TLS-protected transport (e.g., HTTPS) or VPN.

4.2.  Authorization

   Authorization is out of scope of this document.  The CDS records
   present in the zone file are indications of intention to sign/unsign/
   update the DS records of the domain in the parent zone.  This means
   the proceeding of the action is not determined by who issued the
   request.  Therefore, authorization is out of the scope.  Registries
   and registrars who plan to provide this service can, however,
   implement their own policy such as IP white listing, API key, etc.

4.3.  Base URL Locator

   The base URL for registries or registrars who want to provide this
   service to DNS Operators can be made auto-discoverable as an RDAP
   extension.

4.4.  CDS resource

   Path: /domains/{domain}/cds {domain}: is the domain name to be
   operated on

4.4.1.  Initial Trust Establishment (Enable DNSSEC validation)

4.4.1.1.  Request

   Syntax: POST /domains/{domain}/cds

   A DS record based on the CDS record in the child zone file will be
   inserted into the registry and the parent zone file upon the
   successful completion of such request.  If there are multiple CDS
   records in the CDS RRset, multiple DS records will be added.

   Either the CDS/CDNSKEY or the DNSKEY can be used to create the DS
   record.  Note: entity expecting CDNSKEY is still expected accept the
   /cds command.

4.4.1.2.  Response

   o  HTTP Status code 201 indicates a success.

   o  HTTP Status code 400 indicates a failure due to validation.

   o  HTTP Status code 403 indicates a failure due to an invalid
      challenge token.

   o  HTTP Status code 404 indicates the domain does not exist.

   o  HTTP Status code 500 indicates a failure due to unforeseeable
      reasons.

4.4.2.  Removing a DS (turn off DNSSEC)

4.4.2.1.  Request

                   Syntax: DELETE /domains/{domain}/cds

4.4.2.2.  Response

   o  HTTP Status code 200 indicates a success.

   o  HTTP Status code 400 indicates a failure due to validation.

   o  HTTP Status code 404 indicates the domain does not exist.

   o  HTTP Status code 500 indicates a failure due to unforeseeable
      reasons.

4.4.3.  DS Maintenance (Key roll over)

4.4.3.1.  Request

                     Syntax: PUT /domains/{domain}/cds

4.4.3.2.  Response

   o  HTTP Status code 200 indicates a success.

   o  HTTP Status code 400 indicates a failure due to validation.

   o  HTTP Status code 404 indicates the domain does not exist.

   o  HTTP Status code 500 indicates a failure due to unforeseeable
      reasons.

4.5.  Tokens resource

   Path: /domains/{domain}/tokens {domain}: is the domain name to be
   operated on

4.5.1.  Setup Initial Trust Establishment with Challenge

4.5.1.1.  Request

                   Syntax: POST /domains/{domain}/tokens

   A random token to be included as a _delegate TXT record prior
   establishing the DNSSEC initial trust.

4.5.1.2.  Response

   o  HTTP Status code 200 indicates a success.  Token included in the
      body of the response, as a valid TXT record

   o  HTTP Status code 404 indicates the domain does not exist.

   o  HTTP Status code 500 indicates a failure due to unforeseeable
      reasons.

4.6.  Customized Error Messages

   Service providers can provide a customized error message in the
   response body in addition to the HTTP status code defined in the
   previous section.

   This can include an Identifiying number/string that can be used to
   track the requests.

   #Using the definitions This section at the moment contains comments
   from early implementers

4.7.  How to react to 403 on POST cds

   The basic reaction to a 403 on POST /domains/{domain}/cds is to issue
   POST /domains/{domain}/tokens command to fetch the challenge to
   insert into the zone.

5.  Security considerations

   TBD This will hopefully get more zones to become validated thus
   overall the security gain out weights the possible drawbacks.

   risk of takeover ? risk of validation errors < declines transfer
   issues

6.  IANA Actions

   URI ??? TBD

7.  Internationalization Considerations

   This protocol is designed for machine to machine communications
